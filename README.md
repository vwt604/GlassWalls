# GlassWalls

GlassWalls helps home finders make an informed decision on their next move. Users can browse and create reviews for apartments and neighbourhoods, review metrics such as property ratings and landlord approval rates, and save properties to their favourites list. An interactive choropleth map helps identify highly rated neighbourhoods and marks properties by rating.

# Running the project

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.
